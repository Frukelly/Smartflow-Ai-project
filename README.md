## Project Overview
SmartFlow is an intelligent energy distribution system that uses Artificial Intelligence (AI), the Internet of Things (IoT), and cloud computing to manage electricity efficiently. The system monitors energy usage in real time, predicts demand, and balances power distribution automatically. It also detects faults early and alerts technicians, reducing downtime and improving reliability.  

SmartFlow is designed to be scalable and adaptable, making it suitable for small communities, large cities, or even global applications. This project demonstrates how technology can create smarter, safer, and more sustainable energy systems.
